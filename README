**NeoSpaces**  
NeoSpaces is a retro-inspired, GeoCities-style platform designed to help friends stay connected in a personal, ad-free environment. Each friend has their own page—just like the classic GeoCities neighborhoods—where they can share updates, photos, art, or music, and style it however they like. It’s a small-scale, meaningful alternative to social media, bringing back the charm of the early internet’s creativity and connection.

**Planned Features**  
- **Personal Pages**: Friends can fully customize their “homepages” with themes, colors, text, and media—just like the old GeoCities vibe.
- **Neighborhoods & Interest Groups**: Themed communities where friends can explore and contribute content based on shared hobbies or interests.
- **Guestbooks**: Interactive guestbooks for each page, letting friends leave comments or notes, creating a sense of community without follower counts or likes.
- **Collaborative Zine**: A monthly or biweekly zine that each friend can contribute to, showcasing featured updates, art, and content from the group.
- **Bulletin Boards**: Shared boards for events, upcoming plans, or recommendations—like a group calendar or bulletin board.
- **Widget Library**: A collection of fun, interactive widgets to make each page unique, such as shared playlists, mood indicators, to-do lists, or “photo of the day.”
